This work presents a novel method to efficiently factorize the combination of multiple factor graphs having common variables of estimation. The fast-paced innovation in the algebraic graph theory has enabled new tools of state estimation like factor graphs. Recent factor graph formulation for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) like Incremental Smoothing and Mapping using the Bayes tree (ISAM2) has been very successful and garnered much attention. Variable ordering, a well-known technique in linear algebra is employed for solving the factor graph. Our primary contribution in this work is to reuse the variable ordering of the graphs being combined to find the ordering of the fused graph. In the case of mapping, multiple robots provide a great advantage over single robot by providing a faster map coverage and better estimation quality. This coupled with an inevitable increase in the number of robots around us produce a demand for faster algorithms. For example, a city full of self-driving cars could pool their observation measurements rapidly to plan a traffic free navigation. By reusing the variable ordering of the parent graphs we were able to produce an order-of-magnitude difference in the time required for solving the fused graph. We also provide a formal verification to show that the proposed strategy does not violate any of the relevant standards. A common problem in multi-robot SLAM is relative pose graph initialization to produce a globally consistent map. The other contribution addresses this by minimizing a specially formulated error function as a part of solving the factor graph. The performance is illustrated on a publicly available SuiteSparse dataset and the multi-robot AP Hill dataset.

\paragraph{}
I am extremely grateful to my advisor, Professor Michael A. Gennert, for being very kind and providing me the opportunity to work with him. His strong encouragement allowed me to explore some of the critical challenges of this research. He is an epitome of patience and prudence. I also offer my sincerest gratitude to Dr. Stephen Williams for the generosity with his time and answering my uncountable number of questions depending on the needs of the day and sometimes of the hour.  His knowledge and intuitions helped me expedite the process of understanding the whole new world of algebraic graph theory. His lessons on programming, research, and engineering philosophy together pushed me towards becoming a good researcher. I owe him a big deal and thank him for his invaluable support. 
\paragraph{}
I would like to especially thank Dr. Jonathan D. Taylor and credit him as an important person in my life. His advice as a friend has transformed me into a character I was yearning for and few of his quotes are something I will remember my lifetime. The thorough discussions and exchange of ideas with him prepared a way for some of the approaches presented in this thesis. 
\paragraph{}
Thank you, Professor William R. Michalson and Professor Eugene Eberbach for being the part of my advising committee and providing your thoughtful insights. Also, thank you for encouraging to publish this piece of work.
\paragraph{}
I would also like to thank two absolute gentlemen Dr. Sarjoun Skaff and Dr. Juan Pablo Gonzalez for offering me the opportunity and support towards my thesis and endless independence while working at their space. I must mention Dr. Prasanna Kannappan for patiently listening to my problems and sharing a great deal of software knowledge and outdoor activities during my internship. Thanks to Dr. Kavitha Velusamy for being extremely kind and an optimistic manager.
\paragraph{}
Back in India, I would like to thank Professor N. S. Manigandan for introducing me to the research side of robotics and teaching me to tackle challenging problems. 
\paragraph{}
Needless to say, Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has been a wonderful place to learn robotics and has significantly shaped my learning curve and appreciation for research in general. I honestly feel fortunate for having Siddharthan Rajasekaran as my peer during my master's and thank him for his help from time to time. Many thanks to all my friends at WPI.
\paragraph{}
Thanks to Prasanna Parthasarathi for putting his thoughts in my work, Sindhura Chayapathy for helping with Matlab wrapping, Chris Williams and Donte Watson for helping with data collection.
Also thanks to my friends Kamal Vignesh, Vishaal Dhamotharan, Sriram Ramprasad, Sravan Sreeram and Lalith Kumar for their timely favor during the final days of my master's degree.
\paragraph{}
I am deeply indebted to my dearest brother Ajith Kumar for his irreplaceable support and help in successfully writing and defending this thesis. No words to describe the gratitude towards my aunt and uncle, Mrs. and Mr. Iyer and especially Mrs. Iyer for acclimatizing me to a new geography and their love, support, and parent-like care during these two years.
\paragraph{}
Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their lifelong love and support without whose sacrifices, I would never have been able to pursue my dreams. Your selfless affection from another side of the world always keeps me moving forward.
